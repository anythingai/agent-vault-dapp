## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Integration Overview

    A[User Frontend] -->|EIP-712 Sign| B[1inch Order]
    B -->|Submit Order| C[Relayer Service]
    C -->|fillOrder Call| D[1inch LimitOrderProtocol]
    D -->|Create Escrow| E[Cross-Chain Escrow]
    E -->|Coordinate| F[Bitcoin HTLC]
    F -->|Secret Reveal| G[Atomic Completion]
```

### Key Innovation: Seamless Integration

Our solution bridges 1inch's sophisticated order protocol with Bitcoin's UTXO model:

1. **Frontend**: Users sign 1inch-compatible orders using EIP-712
2. **Backend**: Relayer converts orders and calls `fillOrder`
3. **Smart Contracts**: 1inch contracts create escrows for cross-chain coordination
4. **Bitcoin**: Existing HTLC system handles Bitcoin side atomically
5. **Completion**: Shared secrets ensure atomic execution across chains
