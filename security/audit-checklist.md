## Critical Security Issues Identified

### High Priority (Must Fix Before Production)

1. **Logic Bug in EscrowDst.sol Line 147**

   - **Impact**: Public withdrawal mechanism completely broken
   - **Fix Required**: Track escrow creation time and use proper comparison
   - **Test Coverage**: Add comprehensive timing tests

2. **Missing Rate Limiting**
   - **Issue**: No DOS protection at service level
   - **Impact**: Service availability attacks possible
   - **Fix Required**: Implement request rate limiting and circuit breakers

3. **Insufficient Gas Limit Testing**
   - **Issue**: Complex contracts may hit gas limits unexpectedly
   - **Impact**: Failed transactions, funds stuck
   - **Fix Required**: Comprehensive gas optimization and limit testing

### Medium Priority (Address Before Scale)

1. **MEV Protection Incomplete**
   - **Issue**: Exclusive periods may not fully prevent MEV attacks
   - **Impact**: Value extraction by miners/validators
   - **Mitigation**: Consider commit-reveal schemes or private mempools

2. **Cross-Chain Timing Assumptions**
   - **Issue**: Fixed timing assumptions may not hold under stress
   - **Impact**: Failed swaps due to timing mismatches
   - **Mitigation**: Dynamic timing adjustment based on network conditions

3. **Error Handling Edge Cases**
   - **Issue**: Some error conditions may not have proper recovery paths
   - **Impact**: Funds temporarily stuck, poor UX
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive error scenario testing and recovery procedures

### Low Priority (Monitor and Improve)

1. **Frontend Input Validation**
   - **Issue**: Client-side validation only for some inputs
   - **Impact**: Potential UX issues, no security impact
   - **Mitigation**: Add server-side validation redundancy

2. **Monitoring Coverage Gaps**
   - **Issue**: Some edge cases not monitored
   - **Impact**: Delayed incident detection
